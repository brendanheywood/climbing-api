This project is an attempt at creating a set of standards for the exchange of climbing data, for example between climbing sites (eg batch importing a large number of routes) or between databases of climbs and clients of that data - such as xslt's to format it as a guidebook for printing, or a mobile application for live route finding while at the crag.

The first key specification ClimbingSyndication, is an extension of the atom syndication spec with a other mature standards (GeoRSS, GData, KML) to model practically everything needed to represent a climbing route or bouldering problem.

Along the way will be a bunch of little tools to help convert legacy data into this format (or at least part of the way), and other tools to manage and display this data.
