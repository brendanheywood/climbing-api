#summary A specification for representing a set of climbing or bouldering routes

= Introduction =

This syndication format builds on the Atom, MediaRSS and GeoRSS specs to represent a set of climbing routes. In the context of climbing certain fields may take on more special meaning than in the underlying specification.


= Use cases =

1) A mobile application could be a Climbing Syndication and subscribe one or multiple climbing databases. As new routes are published the mobile device periodically updates the guide.

2) Backup and restore of climbing databases, possibly from one climbing database to another.

= Requireents =

1) Must store all critical climbing route data typically found in most climbing guides. So far these fields include:

|| Field || XML element || Example ||
|| id || atom:id || 
|| Name || atom:
* Grade / Grade system
* Description
* Height
* Flags (eg Danger, Highball)
* First Ascender
* First Ascender date
* Link to image
* Geometry of route overlaid onto photo
* Lat / long / alt of route

All field of these are optional.
