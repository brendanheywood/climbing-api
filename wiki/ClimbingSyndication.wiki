#summary A specification for representing a set of climbing or bouldering routes

= Introduction =

This syndication format builds on the Atom, MediaRSS and GeoRSS specs to represent a set of climbing routes. In the context of climbing certain fields may take on more special meaning than in the underlying specification. It gets lots of ideas from the Google Data spec which is also based of Atom.

For consuming this feed,paging and searching is supported through the use of the opensearch xmlns in the same manner as GoogleData.


= Use cases =

1) A mobile application could be a Climbing Syndication and subscribe one or multiple climbing databases. As new routes are published the mobile device periodically updates the guide.

2) Backup and restore of climbing databases, possibly from one climbing database to another.

= Requirements =

1) Must store all critical climbing route data typically found in most climbing guides.

2) Dates need to be flexible to allow just a year or month or a detailed time.

3) Other may use only some parts and still needs to work.

4) Additional namespaces may be added (just like atom) to express more information about the climbs that we haven't thought of yet.

5) The client can request the whole set, or page though the set, or request all updates since a date.

= XML element definitions =

These are the XML schemas used by this spec.
